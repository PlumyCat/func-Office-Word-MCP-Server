# Getting Started with Remote MCP Servers using Azure Functions (Python)

This is a quickstart template to easily build and deploy a custom remote MCP server to the cloud using Azure Functions with Python. You can clone/restore/run on your local machine with debugging, and `azd up` to have it in the cloud in a couple minutes. The MCP server is secured by design using keys and HTTPS, and allows more options for OAuth using built-in auth and/or [API Management](https://aka.ms/mcp-remote-apim-auth) as well as network isolation using VNET.

If you're looking for this sample in more languages check out the [.NET/C#](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-dotnet) and [Node.js/TypeScript](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/remote-mcp-functions-typescript) versions.

## Microsoft Entra application permissions (Graph)

For the Word â†’ PDF conversion via Microsoft Graph and SharePoint, create an app registration in Microsoft Entra ID and grant the following Application permissions (admin consent required):

- Files.ReadWrite.All
- Sites.ReadWrite.All

After granting admin consent, configure the following settings in your Function App (local.settings.json or App Settings in Azure): `TENANT_ID`, `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `SP_DRIVE_ID` (or `SP_SITE_ID`).

The following screenshot illustrates the permissions setup:

## Prerequisites

+ [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.11 or higher
+ [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?pivots=programming-language-python#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools) >= `4.0.7030`
+ [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd)
+ To use Visual Studio Code to run and debug locally:
  + [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  + [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)

## Prepare your local environment

An Azure Storage Emulator is needed for this sample because the Word tools use Azure Blob Storage to store documents.

1. Start Azurite

    ```shell
    docker run -p 10000:10000 -p 10001:10001 -p 10002:10002 \
        mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite
    ```

>**Note** if you use Azurite coming from VS Code extension you need to run `Azurite: Start` now or you will see errors.

## Run your MCP Server locally from the terminal

1. Change to the src folder in a new terminal window:

   ```shell
   cd src
   ```

1. Install Python dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

>**Note** it is a best practice to create a Virtual Environment before doing the `pip install` to avoid dependency issues/collisions, or if you are running in CodeSpaces.  See [Python Environments in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_creating-environments) for more information.

1. Start the Functions host locally:

   ```shell
   func start
   ```

> **Note** by default this will use the webhooks route: `/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse`.  Later we will use this in Azure to set the key on client/host calls: `/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse?code=<system_key>`

## Connect to the *local* MCP server from a client/host

### VS Code - Copilot agent mode

1. **Add MCP Server** from command palette and add URL to your running Function app's SSE endpoint:

    ```shell
    http://0.0.0.0:7071/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse
    ```

1. **List MCP Servers** from command palette, choose your server, and select **Start**
1. In Copilot chat agent mode enter a prompt to trigger a tool, for example:

    ```plaintext
    Say Hello
    ```

1. When prompted to run the tool, consent by clicking **Continue**

1. When you're done, press Ctrl+C in the terminal window to stop the Functions host process.

### MCP Inspector

1. In a **new terminal window**, install and run MCP Inspector

    ```shell
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
    ```

2. CTRL click to load the MCP Inspector web app from the URL displayed by the app (e.g. http://0.0.0.0:5173/#resources)
3. Set the transport type to `SSE`
4. Set the URL to your running Function app's SSE endpoint and **Connect**:

    ```shell
    http://0.0.0.0:7071/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse
    ```

>**Note** this step will not work in CodeSpaces.  Please move on to Deploy to Remote MCP.  

5. **List Tools**.  Click on a tool and **Run Tool**.



## Deploy to Azure for Remote MCP

Run this [azd](https://aka.ms/azd) command to provision the function app, with any required Azure resources, and deploy your code:

```shell
azd up
```

You can opt-in to a VNet being used in the sample. To do so, do this before `azd up`

```bash
azd env set VNET_ENABLED true
```

Additionally, [API Management]() can be used for improved security and policies over your MCP Server, and [App Service built-in authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization) can be used to set up your favorite OAuth provider including Entra.  

## Connect to your *remote* MCP server function app from a client

Your client will need a key in order to invoke the new hosted SSE endpoint, which will be of the form `https://<funcappname>.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse`. The hosted function requires a system key by default which can be obtained from the [portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/function-keys-how-to?tabs=azure-portal) or the CLI (`az functionapp keys list --resource-group <resource_group> --name <function_app_name>`). Obtain the system key named `mcp_extension`.

### Connect to remote MCP server in MCP Inspector
For MCP Inspector, you can include the key in the URL: 
```plaintext
https://<funcappname>.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse?code=<your-mcp-extension-system-key>
```

### Connect to remote MCP server in VS Code - GitHub Copilot
For GitHub Copilot within VS Code, you should instead set the key as the `x-functions-key` header in `mcp.json`, and you would just use `https://<funcappname>.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse` for the URL. The following example uses an input and will prompt you to provide the key when you start the server from VS Code.  Note [mcp.json](.vscode/mcp.json) has already been included in this repo and will be picked up by VS Code.  Click Start on the server to be prompted for values including `functionapp-name` (in your /.azure/*/.env file) and `functions-mcp-extension-system-key` which can be obtained from CLI command above or API Keys in the portal for the Function App.  

```json
{
    "inputs": [
        {
            "type": "promptString",
            "id": "functions-mcp-extension-system-key",
            "description": "Azure Functions MCP Extension System Key",
            "password": true
        },
        {
            "type": "promptString",
            "id": "functionapp-name",
            "description": "Azure Functions App Name"
        }
    ],
    "servers": {
        "remote-mcp-function": {
            "type": "sse",
            "url": "https://${input:functionapp-name}.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse",
            "headers": {
                "x-functions-key": "${input:functions-mcp-extension-system-key}"
            }
        },
        "local-mcp-function": {
            "type": "sse",
            "url": "http://0.0.0.0:7071/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse"
        }
    }
}
```

For MCP Inspector, you can include the key in the URL: `https://<funcappname>.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse?code=<your-mcp-extension-system-key>`.

For GitHub Copilot within VS Code, you should instead set the key as the `x-functions-key` header in `mcp.json`, and you would just use `https://<funcappname>.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse` for the URL. The following example uses an input and will prompt you to provide the key when you start the server from VS Code:

```json
{
    "inputs": [
        {
            "type": "promptString",
            "id": "functions-mcp-extension-system-key",
            "description": "Azure Functions MCP Extension System Key",
            "password": true
        }
    ],
    "servers": {
        "my-mcp-server": {
            "type": "sse",
            "url": "<funcappname>.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/mcp/sse",
            "headers": {
                "x-functions-key": "${input:functions-mcp-extension-system-key}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Redeploy your code

You can run the `azd up` command as many times as you need to both provision your Azure resources and deploy code updates to your function app.

>[!NOTE]
>Deployed code files are always overwritten by the latest deployment package.

## Clean up resources

When you're done working with your function app and related resources, you can use this command to delete the function app and its related resources from Azure and avoid incurring any further costs:

```shell
azd down
```

## Helpful Azure Commands

Once your application is deployed, you can use these commands to manage and monitor your application:

```bash
# Get your function app name from the environment file
FUNCTION_APP_NAME=$(cat .azure/$(cat .azure/config.json | jq -r '.defaultEnvironment')/env.json | jq -r '.FUNCTION_APP_NAME')
echo $FUNCTION_APP_NAME

# Get resource group 
RESOURCE_GROUP=$(cat .azure/$(cat .azure/config.json | jq -r '.defaultEnvironment')/env.json | jq -r '.AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP')
echo $RESOURCE_GROUP

# View function app logs
az webapp log tail --name $FUNCTION_APP_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP

# Redeploy the application without provisioning new resources
azd deploy
```

## Source Code

The function code for each MCP tool is defined in the Python files in the `src` directory. Functions are exposed as MCP tools using the `@app.generic_trigger` decorator.

Here's the `hello_mcp` tool from `function_app.py`:

```python
@app.generic_trigger(
    arg_name="context",
    type="mcpToolTrigger",
    toolName="hello_mcp",
    description="Hello world.",
    toolProperties="[]",
)
def hello_mcp(context) -> None:
    """A simple function that returns a greeting message."""
    return "Hello I am MCPTool!"
```

Note that the `host.json` file also includes a reference to the experimental bundle, which is required for apps using this feature:

```json
"extensionBundle": {
  "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Experimental",
  "version": "[4.*, 5.0.0)"
}
```
